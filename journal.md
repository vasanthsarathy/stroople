- Game overview: Stroople is a simple game where you get points for clicking certain shapes and colors based on a rule. More correct clicks = more points. Wrong clicks and you lose a life. Loose three lives and you lose game. You have 90 seconds! Oh and wait, the rule for what you can and cannot click changes every 10 seconds.
